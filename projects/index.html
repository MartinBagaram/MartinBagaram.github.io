        <a href="https://github.com/MartinBagaram/shortest-route" target="_blank"><h3>Shortest path problem</h3> </a>  
        <p>It is a small Java code that finds the shortest route from a point A to a point B. 
            The algorithm solve a very common question asked in ecology as how to route animals, build a road network.
            The algorithm is not complete yet. The next step is to implement it in Javascript and allow visualisation of the 
            initial network and of the solution proposed.

        <p>This research explored the capability of a UAV, namely the eBee drone, imagery to map forest canopy gaps and 
            derive some forest parameters such as, biodiversity indices, habitat trees, basal area, canopy height, deadwood,
             etc. using handy techniques in a test area of 240 ha of natural reserve of Lago di Vico in Central Italy. 
             We used correlation and linear regression techniques to explore relationships between gaps patch metrics on
              one side and forest features on the other.  
            The mapping revealed that forest shaded canopy gaps can be faithfully extracted from UAV RGB color images. 
            Estimation of forest features using canopy gaps as a proxy led to disparate results. Best results were obtained 
            for understorey data with R<sup>2</sup> going up to 0.87 and intermediate results were observed in living trees data with 
            R<sup>2</sup> of over 0.74. The approach failed to estimate the deadwood. Additionally, from the three forest 
            types available in the study area, best results were observed in mixed forest while Fagus forest had the poorest 
            ones and Quercus forest displayed intermediate results. UAV true color remote sensing presents a high potential 
            for forest inventory, forest monitoring, and biodiversity assessment.

        <i><img src="../../img/geostat.png" alt="" width="100%"></i>
        <i><p>Soil is the most important factor precluding cork oak regeneration in the Maamora forest. Regeneration and 
            reforestation success rate depends on upper soil layer thickness, which is sandy and resting above a clay layer. 
            This study was conducted in order to assess sand thickness and to recommend a reasonable and efficient sampling 
            grid that will minimize mapping cost. To achieve this goal, 1912 plots have been collected according to a 
            systematic sampling grid of 500 m. In addition, and to better understand sand thickness variability, another 
            sampling scheme concerned one stand. It consists of systematic points located at 100 m distance.  The data 
            have been processed using ordinary kriging. The results show that sand thickness is variable and is not related to 
            terrain slope. Also, within a sampling grid of 500 m, only around 40% of the sand thickness is spatially 
            auto-correlated. Furthermore, there is an anisotropy in the variation of the thickness of the sand. 
            As conclusion, a systematic sampling grid with plots within 200 to 350 m distance seems to be well suited.</p></i>
