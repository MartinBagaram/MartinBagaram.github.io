      <p>I was born in northern part of Togo, Kara where I grew up mixing farming life to school. However, I finally completed 
          my high school degree in Sokod&eacute in central part of Togo. From there my adventure started. 
        </p>
        <p>I visited couple of West African countries such as Benin and Niger and then was awarded a merit scholarship by both Togolese and 
          Moroccan governments. 
        </p>
        <p>My first years of university, I took classes to prepare myself for chemical engineering school. But quickly after few chemistry labs,
          I was caught back by my passion for the nature and outdoor activities. I therefore switched to forest engineering school.
          The beauty of the school stems from its combination of military education and a scientific career. I spent a great amount of time in the school since it 
          was a boarding school style. I highly improved myself from the school. I learned leadership, responsibility, and discipline. Few qualities that 
          I proudly brandish. 
        </p>
        <p>I graduated from the school with a forest engineering degree and years later I deepened my knowledge by getting a specialized engineering/MSc degree in Waters and Forests 
          specialized in Geo-information of natural resources management. 
          Upon my graduation I worked for a local company operating in GIS and Remote sensing. I worked on assessing natural risks (flood, earthquake, fire, avalanche, etc.)
          of Arab countries. The work lead to an executive summary appearing on <a href="http://www.unisdr.org/files/45145_desinventarfullreport.pdf" target="_blank">UNISDR website</a>. 
          After 8 months of work I went back to Togo where I worked 
          for a local company specialized in selling ESRI products in Togo. Although the job has the benefit of being up-to-date on the latest technology 
          of ESRI product, it lacked the technical aspect I was looking for and solely focused on marketing and transfer of competence.
        </p>
        <p>I was awarded a fellowship by the European Union, Erasmus Mundus to pursue a master program in Mediterranean Forestry and Multi-objectives
          decision support systems. I enhanced my knowledge on mathematical modelling known as Research Operations at University of Lisbon (Instituto Superior do Agronomia)
        . And for the second year of my master program I went to University of Tuscia in Italy. I wrote my master thesis in there on the use of drones - 
        Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) use to assess forest and biodiversity parameters. I obtained my master degree with the maximum points awarded by the 
        Italian system <strong><i>110/110 e lode</i> </strong>which means with honors.
        </p>
        <p>This master opened doors for PhD possibilities explaining my admission at University of Washington, a prestigious university</p>
        <p>I co-founded an <a href="http://apedd.info/" target="_blank">NGO</a>  operating in the environment back in my home country and at University of Washington, I sit on IT commettee 
          board as grad students representative</p>
